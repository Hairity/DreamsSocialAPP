# DreamsSocialAPP

DREAMS | Social media app which can be explained like a child of Twitter and Instagram. You don't tweet little messages but you post dreams or moments. Like little pictures and you can add tags, title and comment under them. It was mostly done on purpose to learn more about React.


# DREAMS 
APP where you can post pictures with tags, title and description. You can also edit and like them.
What I learned: Database, server (express and mongoose), React, Redux, React Hooks, API, JSON Web Token(JWT), OAuth and Google Auth. It was pretty big project and hard work.
